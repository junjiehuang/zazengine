Libraries:
 * Integrate Boost: needed for LUA. useful for concurrency, low-level networking, reflection
 * if possible find and add some high-level networking library
 * maybe integrate qt for higher level networking, GUI and metaobject system. but most probably too heavy weight for just those things

Refactor:
 * remove system stuff ( semaphore ) : use boost instead
 * remove memory allocators: use boost instead
 * make a real component based system: subsystems compile into library and are loaded at runtime. this mechanism can be used to easily extend the engine.
