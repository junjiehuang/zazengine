Libraries:
 * Integrate Boost: needed for LUA. useful for concurrency, low-level networking, reflection.
 * if possible find and add some high-level networking library
 * Qt too heavyweight, Boost should suffice.

Refactor:
 * remove system stuff ( semaphore ) : use boost instead
 * remove memory allocators: use boost instead
 * make a real component based system: subsystems compile into library and are loaded at runtime. this mechanism can be used to easily extend the engine.
