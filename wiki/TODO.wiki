Libraries:
 * Integrate Boost: needed for LUA. useful for concurrency, low-level networking, reflection.
 * if possible find and add some high-level networking library
 * Qt too heavyweight, Boost should suffice.

Boost libraries interesting for zazengine:
 * asio - very good networking library
 * bind - used for luabind
 * flyweight - could become interesting for handling larege number of objects
 * Functional/Factory - dynamic and static object creation
 * In Place Factory, Typed In Place Factory - Generic in-place construction of contained objects with a variadic argument-list.
 * MPL - metaprogramming 
 * Pool - memory pool management for better performance
 * Random - random number generation
 * Signals & Signals2 - Managed signals & slots callback implementation ( 2 is thread safe )
 * Thread - multithreading
 * Timer
 * Variant - Safe, generic, stack-based discriminated union container.

Refactor:
 * remove system stuff ( semaphore ) : use boost instead
 * remove memory allocators: use boost instead
 * make a real component based system: subsystems compile into library and are loaded at runtime. this mechanism can be used to easily extend the engine.
