describes the roadmap of ZaZENgine

Development should happen under the motto: „First make it work, then make it look good and then make it work fast“. Don't waste too much time in small details, try to get a correct result as fast as possible, then make it beautiful both in code and visual appearance. Bevore the renderer is not finished, no big optimizations should happen.

ALWAYS: find a good game-ida
- full 3D with beautiful materials and lighting, no iso&2d
- playing, creating, experiencing, fascinating (PCEF)
- no destruction & hard working in the game (e.g. shooter )
- music: ambient, so game must fit into this kind of music

Finish Renderer
- material-system
- shadow-maping
- multi-lights

Overhaul Architecture
- split into separate libs - clean separation into header files needed
- loading of libs/modules at runtime

Implement Scripting-Mechanism
- depends on the kind of game

Implement Sound
- expand usage of fmod

Implement AI
- use existing open-source ai
- use existing open-source pathfinding

Implement Networking
- use existing networking lib
