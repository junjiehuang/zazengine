Development should happen under the motto: „First make it work, then make it look good and then make it work fast“. Don't waste too much time in small details, try to get a correct result as fast as possible, then make it beautiful both in code and visual appearance. Bevore the renderer is not finished, no big optimizations should happen.

*ALWAYS: find a good game-idea*
  *full 3D with beautiful materials and lighting, no iso&2d
  *playing, creating, experiencing, fascinating (PCEF)
  *should behave like a simulation, independent from the player
  *player can change the simulation by invoking actions
  *no destruction & hard working in the game (e.g. shooter )
  *music: ambient, so game must fit into this kind of music

*Finish Renderer*
  *material-system
  *deferred shadow-maping
  *multi-lights

*Overhaul Architecture*
  *split into separate libs - clean separation into header files needed
  *loading of libs/modules at runtime

*Implement Scripting-Mechanism*
  *depends on the kind of game

*Implement Sound*
  *expand usage of fmod
  *sound-events

*Implement AI*
  *use existing open-source ai
  *use existing open-source pathfinding

*Implement Networking*
  *use existing networking lib
