This Page describes the first steps and ideas to implement

# Introduction #

To implement an engine purely for the sake of itself is difficult without some gamingidea to implement with this engine because during impelmenting many details will show up and the engine has to be refined. This process should never stop and with the time the engine grows more and more robust and flexible automatically. This Page lists the ideas to implement and discusses shortly how to implement each.
The basic idea is to implement a vehicle like in wipeout but with more complex and more free steering experience.

Physics & Game-Mechanics
  * rear jet-stream
  * bottom jet-stream
  * anti-gravity pads ( vertical floating )
  * acceleration of both jet streams
  * jet-streams able to turn on/off
  * simple steering: no roll, no up, just left-right
  * fuel consumption
  * basic joystick input

Graphics & Effects
  * front lights: spot & shadow casting
  * jet streams: point lights & shadow casting
  * jet-streams: fire/particles
  * interesting ship-model with high poly count
  * texture ship
  * display of fuel: 2D Overlay
  * display of radar: 2D Overlay
  * very very simple world

Sound & Music
  * collision sounds
  * jet-stream sounds: raise pitch the more output
  * anti-grav-pad sounds
  * music ambient
